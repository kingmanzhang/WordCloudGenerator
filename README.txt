This app analyzes a text file and create a world cloud based on the frequency of word occurrence. To run the app, the user need to type in the input file name, the output file name, a file containing words to ignore and the max number of words to include in the word cloud. 

The app implements a number of key data structures including stack, binary search tree and priority queue. Words to ignore are first added to the binary search tree. The input file is parsed into single words and the words are added to another binary search tree if they are not in the ignore list. The frequency of words in the input file is updated in the binary search tree. Afterward, all the words from the input file are added to a priority queue. Finally, the most frequent words are added to a final binary search tree for generating word cloud, which is saved in the HTML file.
